 ## Details
 This module is working primarily on a cosmetic level as it's just renaming the 5e currencies as follows:


5e Default| |Odyssey
--- | --- | ---
Platinum|-->|*REMOVED*
Gold|-->|Drachma
Electrum|-->|*REMOVED*
Silver|-->|Lepton
Copper|-->|*REMOVED*
     
In addition to the renaming and hiding of currencies the conversion button's formula has been altered to have 1 Drachma equal 100 Lepta.
